## About
<p>This project is devoted to performing data analysis against the 2019 tax season return records of all Universities to determine which schools took the biggest losses in finances.  During said season, the school which I attended (Wentworth Institute of Technology) was emailing us stating that they were running a negative and needed to adjust tuitions accordingly. </p>

<p>In looking at Wentworth's 2019 Tax records, it shows that they ran a considerable profit (~$10-13 million,) which doesn't correlate with the raised tuitions. This project will consist of grabbing tax data from aggregate sites or the IRS site itself, then analysing said data to determine which schools were lying and which were telling the truth regarding their finances.</p>
